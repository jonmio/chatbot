When a new user gets started add them to the pool of users

When someone in the pool of users sends you an image, five five non busy users and send them the picture and mark as busy

If someone sends a button reply back check if the id is a user_id someone is waiting for
  If true add it to the original user json

  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
